#### at Dirac, we're quantum fanatics!

Diving deep into the wild world of quantum circuits to unlock game-changing advantages. We're mapping qubits and quantum gates to tackle big problems, with projects like [Antinature](https://antinature.dirac.fun) and [Early Universe Asymmetry Study](https://github.com/mk0dz/bigbang-events) already making waves.

We're also stoked about blockchain, pushing boundaries with [quantum hashing](https://hashes.dirac.fun) and real-world [applications](https://crypto.dirac.fun).

Our flagship mission? The Universal Quantum Neural Network [(UQNN)](https://uqnn.dirac.fun)â€”a quantum-powered "brain" designed to solve complex, multidisciplinary science challenges with a quantum edge. Join us in rewriting the future!
